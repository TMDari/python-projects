When downloading this you need to run it in 
for example visual studio with the python extension.

But first extract the zip file.
now you want to open visual studio or any other programm
to run/programm code files, and make sure it is capable of running a .py file.

now make everything ready and open the folder then open ChipOS.py with the
programm you use.

now run that.
you made my "OS" run.
its just a interface basicly.
